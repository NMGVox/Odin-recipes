# Odin-recipes
The following repository is for and Odin project named Recipes. 

In this project, I must build a basic recipe website using th knowledge 
I have aquired during this part of the course. The website consists of 
a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.  

Witihin index.html, there will be links to other web pages that have
detailed recipes on different dishes. These webpages will be housed
in a directory called "recipes." 

For each recipe, there will be a header with the name of the dish,
a description of the didh, an unordedred list including the ingredients
for the dish, and an ordered list including the steps to make the dish.

Three recipes are included.
