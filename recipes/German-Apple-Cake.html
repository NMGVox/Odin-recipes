    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4> 
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 2 </h4> 
            <p>Beat oil and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and vanilla; beat well. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 3 </h4> 
            <p>Stir together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to egg mixture; mix until combined. 
                The batter will be very thick. Fold in apples by hand using a wooden spoon. Spread batter into the prepared pan.

        <li><h4>Step 4 </h4> 
            <p>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake on a 
                wire rack.
